#+TITLE: CENIX

Cenix is a small learning project for me to learn: ~make~, *C++*, memory managment, syscalls and a host of other things. 

** User programs
*** CESH 
Is the default ~shell~ it's pronounced sesh (the Sess in Session)

*** MTE
MTE stands for martin's text editor, it's ~nano~-like, in that it does not have modes like ~vi~ and it displays the keybindings

*** Navtool
The navtool is a mix of ~mkdir~, ~rm~, ~touch~ in one program

*** Printxt
A clone of the unix ~echo~ utility 1:1

** Games

*** Tic Tac Toe
A simple implamentation of the classic tictactoe in C++ cli form

*** Hangman
WIP

*** Snake
WIP


* Goals
- [-] Write a custom kernel (using linux for now)
- [-] Write all the programs
